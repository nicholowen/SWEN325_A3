# SWEN325 Assignment 3 - Ionic React App

## Description

This application is to demonstrate the use of an external API to manage and IoT device, in this case, controlling devices using the Philips Hue API.
It makes use of fetch and request calls with specific bodys to recieve details and push instructions to the Hue Bridge (the communcation hub), in turn controlling the device.
As I only had access to light bulbs, this app was only configured to control them, however given more devices, it can be configured to address those as well.

## Other Information

This also makes use of Firebase for authentication purposes, but was intended to allow remote access to the Philips Hue Bridge and set specific permissions within a household.
